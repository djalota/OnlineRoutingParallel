# OnlineRoutingParallel

This repository contains data and code associated with the paper "Online Routing over Parallel Networks: Deterministic Limits and Data-driven Enhancements" submitted to the Informs Journal on Computing.

## Data Sources and Format
All data sources are either .xlsx or .csv files and were obtained from several sources:

1. TomTom: Travel time information for main highway routes between San Jose and San Francisco for the case study
2. CalTrans' PeMS Database: Flow rate information of users along the three main highways between San Jose and San Francisco
3. Statistical Atlas: Household income levels in the Bay Area, which are used to calibrate the values of time of users

The travel time, arrival rate, and household income inforamtion from these data sources is compiled into the file "Aggregated_Data_Experiments.xlsx" in the folder "CompiledData".
